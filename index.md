# Short Bio
I'm currently a Ph.D candidate in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before that, I received my B.S. degree (2017) and M.E. degree (2020) in East China Normal University, respectively. From 2020 to 2022, I was employed in the Institute of Financial Technology, China UnionPay. My current research interest includes **GNN (Graph Neural Network)** and **AI for EDA (Electronics Design Automation)**. Welcome to contact with me: <u>duxingbo@sjtu.edu.cn</u>.

# Education

# Career
+ **China UnionPay Co., Ltd**, Institute of Financial Technology, Researcher (2020/07 ~ 2022/03)
  + Member of key special project 'research and application demonstration of financial fraud and payment acceptance market violation detection and disposal technology', which is part of **the national key research and development program** 'social governance and smart society technology support'.
  + Through large-scale graph computing and graph neural network algorithms, I acted as a project leader and completed the identification and prevention algorithm research of various risk control scenarios such as scalpers, gambling, fraud and counterfeiting. Besides, I participated in the construction of risk control knowledge graph, effectively improving the risk control efficiency, and assisting the Ministry of Public Security to discover some important fraud groups. 
  + During the tenure, I applied for 13 invention patents, including 6 as the first inventor.

# Internship
+ **Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Innovation Center**, Intern Researcher (2022/06 ~ Now)
  + Research on the interpretability of neural networks for trusted security. We study the concept bottleneck model in image classification and propose a human-computer interaction system based on semantic information, which can implement model intervention and correction.
