# Short Bio
Hi, I'm Rui. I obtained my B.S. degree from East China Normal University in 2019 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2024. After completing my doctorate, I joined Renmin University of China as a postdoctoral researcher. My main research interests include **physics-driven deep learning** and **interpretable neural networks**. During my doctoral studies, I was honored with awards such as the AMSS Special Prize of President Scholarship and the Hua Loo-Keng Scholarship. My work has been published in journals and conferences, including IEEE TPAMI, National Science Review, Physics of Fluids, and AAAI. Feel free to contact me at <u>rayzhang@ruc.edu.cn</u>.
